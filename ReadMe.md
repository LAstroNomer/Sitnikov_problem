## What does this script do?
***

1. Solve Sitnikov problem for one or any data
2. Create and plot Poinkare map.

## Equation of motion

***

The Sitnikov problem is a particular case of 3-body problem. We have two body with masses $m_1$ and $m_2$. They move on elliptic orbits around common center of mass by Kepler law. Therd body moves perpendicular to the plane of their orbits throught the center of mass. The mass of therd body we accept equals to zero. This situation is depicted in the figure below.
